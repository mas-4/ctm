Chapter 1
=========

Well that's nuts, by the Pythagorean theorem (probably the single most useful
formula in all of mathematics), we have

```
|z|² = (z.real)² + (z.imag)²
```

So that, since (3,4,5) are a Pythagorean Triple,

```
abs(3+4j) == 5.0
```

The conjugate of a complex number z, written z‾ (z bar), is defined as z.real -
z.imag.

Also, |z|² = z * z‾.

This makes sense because FOIL.

Translations are addition and subtraction operations

Scaling operations are multiplication operations (scalars).

Rotations are just negative scalars on one term?

Multiplying x + iy by i yields ix + i²y which is ix-y. This takes (x,y) and
yields (-y, x) which is a rotation by 90 degrees.

So basically rotations are actually just scaling by complex numbers.

Observation by me: since (x + yi) * i => 90° rotation, and π radians represents
a 180° rotation, i = π/2, so 180° = 2i = π and 360° = 4i = 2π.
